            <h3>I'm a <span>Web Developer</span></h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Mohd Subhan, a passionate Web Developer with a love for creating visually stunning and
                user-friendly websites. With a background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've developed a keen eye for
                detail and a solid understanding of responsive web design, ensuring that websites look great on any
                device.</p>
           <!-- <p>Throughout my career, I've worked with various frontend frameworks such as React and React-Native, as
                well as tools like Sass and Webpack to streamline development processes. I always focus on writing
                clean, maintainable code, and I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments.</p>-->
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying updated with the latest web technologies, experimenting with new
                design trends, and contributing to open-source projects. My goal is to continue growing as a developer
                and help bring innovative ideas to life through the web.</p>
